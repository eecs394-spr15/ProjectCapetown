 #### Download Source Code
 *  Option 1: Clone the github repo: Run this command in your terminal/cmd: `git clone https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/ProjectCapetown.git` 
 *  Option 2: Get source code from the github: https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/ProjectCapetown.git
 
 For either option:

* [Build settings for Android](http://docs.appgyver.com/tooling/build-service/build-settings/build-settings-for-android/)
* [Build settings for iOS](http://docs.appgyver.com/tooling/build-service/build-settings/build-settings-for-ios/)
* [Android build types](http://docs.appgyver.com/tooling/build-service/build-settings/android-build-types/)
* [iOS build types](http://docs.appgyver.com/tooling/build-service/build-settings/ios-build-types/)

 
 ## Going Forward
* Build other types of games
* Implement Learn section with whole flowcharts
* Implement a better way of adding new case materials
* Currently, in order to edit content in Intro, Case Studies, or Game, our clients (Katherine and Linda) must change content directly in the html files.  This is not convenient, and requires comprehensive instructions.  We will be dilivering the app with such instructions included.     
 
 ## Limitations of the app
-* This application was built to run on android tablets to train nurses in Cape Town. One of the major restrictions was not using WIFI. Therefore, we have saved all of the contents inside our application. It is much harder for the application managers to change contents of this application since they would have to reprogramm every tablet (no updates via WIFI).
